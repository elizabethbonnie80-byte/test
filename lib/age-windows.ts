/**
 * Client-side deal age-window helpers.
 *
 * The AUTHORITATIVE partitioning of deals into New / Maturing / Expired lives in the SQL feed
 * functions (maturing_deals_for_lender uses a 2-day New→Maturing boundary and a 15-day
 * Maturing→Expired boundary — Round 3, migration 37). The New Deals page receives every open deal
 * from open_deals_for_lender and highlights the recently-submitted ones client-side, so it needs the
 * same New boundary in TS. Keep this in sync with the SQL — it can't be imported from Postgres.
 * Define it ONCE here; never inline a raw day-count or (worse) an absolute calendar date at a call site.
 *
 * Round 3 (approved 2026-07-13, supersedes OQ#18): New = 0–1 days / Maturing = 2–14 days / Expired = 15+.
